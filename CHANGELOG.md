## [Unreleased]

✓ means ready to try

New:
- cookie auth & its specification in TD (cookie auth branch)
- adding custom handlers for each property, action and event to override default behaviour
- pydantic & JSON schema support for property models 

Bug Fixes:
- composed sub`Thing`s exposed with correct URL path 

## [v0.2.7] - 2024-10-22

- HTTP SSE would previously remain unclosed when client abruptly disconnected (like closing a browser tab), but now it would close correctly
- retrieve unserialized data from events with `ObjectProxy` (like JPEG images) by setting `deserialize=False` in `subscribe_event()` 

## [v0.2.6] - 2024-09-09

- bug fix events when multiple serializers are used
- events support custom HTTP handlers (not polished yet, use as last resort, not auto-added to TD)
- image event handlers for streaming live video as JPEG and PNG (not polished yet, not auto-added to TD)

## [v0.2.5] - 2024-09-09

- released to anaconda, it can take a while to turn up. A badge will be added in README when successful.  

## [v0.2.4] - 2024-09-09

- added multiple versions of python for testing
- unlike claimed in previous versions, this package runs only on python 3.11 or higher

## [v0.2.3] - 2024-08-11

- HTTP SSE minor bug-fix/optimization - no difference to the user 

## [v0.2.2] - 2024-08-09

- thing control panel works better with the server side and support observable properties
- `ObjectProxy` client API has been improved to resemble WoT operations better, for example `get_property` is now 
called `read_property`, `set_properties` is now called `write_multiple_properties`. 
- `ObjectProxy` client reliability for poorly written server side actions improved

## [v0.2.1] - 2024-07-21

### Added
- properties are now "observable" and push change events when read or written & value has changed
- input & output JSON schema can be specified for actions, where input schema is used for validation of arguments
- TD has read/write properties' forms at thing level, event data schema
- change log
- some unit tests

### Changed
- events are to specified as descriptors and are not allowed as instance attributes. Specify at class level to 
  automatically obtain a instance specific event.  

### Fixed
- ``class_member`` argument for properties respected more accurately

## [v0.1.2] - 2024-06-06

### Added
- first public release to pip, docs are the best source to document this release. Checkout commit 
  [04b75a73c28cab298eefa30746bbb0e06221b81c] and build docs if at all necessary.
